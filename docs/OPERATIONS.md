## Monitoring

### Health Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Expected |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` | Control plane liveness | `200 OK` |
| `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ready` | Control plane readiness | `200 OK` after migrations |
| `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health/deep` | Component-level deep health | `200 OK` (degraded) or `503` (unhealthy) |
| `curl http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics` | Agent Prometheus metrics | Prometheus text format |

#### Deep Health Check

The `/health/deep` endpoint reports per-component health:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/health/deep | jq .
```

Example response (`healthy`):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "components": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "latency_ms": 2 },
    "agent_socket_dir": { "status": "healthy" },
    "agent_connectivity": { "status": "healthy" }
  }
}
```

- **`database`**: SQLite connectivity with latency measurement.
- **`agent_socket_dir`**: Agent runtime directory exists and is readable.
- **`agent_connectivity`**: Can establish a Unix socket connection to at least one agent.

Status semantics:
- `healthy` — all components pass (HTTP 200)
- `degraded` — database passes but agent issues (HTTP 200, still serving)
- `unhealthy` — database fails (HTTP 503)

### Key Prometheus Metrics

```
chv_vms_total{status="running"}
chv_nodes_ready
chv_operations_completed_total{status="succeeded"}
chv_operations_latency_seconds_bucket
```

#### Circuit Breaker Behavior

Node communication from the control plane is protected by a circuit breaker (`Closed` → `Open` → `HalfOpen`). When open, RPCs to that node are rejected immediately with `BackendUnavailable` without attempting the call. The breaker probes with single requests every 30s (default) in `HalfOpen` state and closes after 3 consecutive successes.

Agent connectivity metrics on `:9901/metrics` complement this:

```
# 1 = connected, 0 = disconnected
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_cp_connected

# Duration of current disconnect in ms
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_cp_disconnected_duration_ms
```

Core journal health (core-managed authority mode only — the metrics
endpoint is part of the legacy/core-managed startup; core-native does not
serve it, and the families are absent in legacy mode):

```
# Current count of InspectRequired operations awaiting operator resolution
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_journal_inspect_required

# 1 = the journal scanner is healthy, 0 = wedged/failing
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_journal_healthy

# Cumulative failed journal scans since agent start
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_journal_scan_failures_total
```

#### Partition / Autonomy Metrics

When an agent loses control-plane connectivity, it enters autonomous mode:

```
# 1 = connected, 0 = disconnected
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_cp_connected

# Duration of current disconnect in ms
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_agent_cp_disconnected_duration_ms
```

During a partition:
- Existing VMs continue running.
- `CreateVm` and `MigrateVm` RPCs are rejected with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
- `StopVm` and `RebootVm` for existing VMs are allowed.
- Upon reconnection, pending messages are flushed in order.

### systemd Service Status

```bash
# All services
systemctl status chv-controlplane chv-agent chv-stord chv-nwd nginx

# Watch logs
journalctl -u chv-controlplane -f
journalctl -u chv-agent -f
journalctl -u chv-stord -f
journalctl -u chv-nwd -f
```

| `--server` | `http://localhost:8080` | BFF server URL |
| `--token` | (from `~/.chv/credentials`) | Auth token override |
| `--output` | `table` | Output format: `table`, `json`, `yaml` |

### Commands

| Command | Subcommands | Description |

chvctl vm resize <VM_ID> --cpu 4 --memory-mb 8192
```

---

## Backup and Restore

### SQLite Database Backup

The database lives at `/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db`. Back up before upgrades or migrations. Always open the live database read-only (see [Live Database Access](#live-database-access)):

```bash
# Online backup (SQLite backup API, read-only source — safe while the CP runs)
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" ".backup '/backup/chv-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db'"

# Automated pre-migration backup (built into chv-controlplane)
# The control plane automatically backs up the DB before running migrations,
# keeping the last 10 backups in /var/lib/chv/backups/.
```

#### Credential encryption key (back it up with the database)

S3 backup credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). The key material
lives in `/etc/chv/encryption.env` (`CHV_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, mode 0600 root),
minted once at install time by the package postinst or `install.sh` and
loaded by `chv-controlplane.service` via `EnvironmentFile`. It is never
regenerated on upgrade.

- **Back it up together with the database.** A database restore without the
  matching key leaves stored S3 credentials unreadable (they are treated as
  missing and must be re-entered in the backup schedule settings).
- **Rotation** is manual: write a new key to `/etc/chv/encryption.env`
  (0600 root), `systemctl restart chv-controlplane`, then re-enter the S3
  credentials — values encrypted under the old key read as missing, not
  corrupted, so the re-entry is safe.
- If the file is absent (or the key is present but empty), the control
  plane logs a warning and stores S3 credentials in **plaintext** — do
  not run production deployments that way.
- **Upgrading a pre-#335 host:** the postinst mints the key, but a
  *running* control plane does not re-read `EnvironmentFile` until
  restarted — `systemctl restart chv-controlplane` after the upgrade to
  activate encryption.

## Live Database Access

The control plane holds the database in WAL mode with a pool of open
connections. Rules for touching it from outside:

- **Reads — always use a read-only URI.** `sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" "SELECT ..."` is safe while the control plane runs: read-only opens never remove or rewrite the WAL sidecars and cannot race control-plane transactions.
- **Never open the live database read-write.** There is no operation that needs it: while the control plane's connection pool holds open connections, an external read-write close cannot remove the sidecars (SQLite removes `-wal`/`-shm` only when the last connection closes), but on a quiet deployment the pool can drain and an external read-write close then removes them. That is recovered transparently when the control plane reopens, but it is an avoidable risk — and a read-write open takes write locks that can block the control plane.
- **Never manipulate the database files directly while the control plane runs** — deleting `-wal`/`-shm`, copying a file over the database, or "cleaning up" sidecars. With open control-plane connections, subsequent commits continue into the deleted inode and are **silently lost** (verified: the connection keeps accepting writes, nothing errors, the data is gone). If sidecar files are inconsistent, stop the control plane first.
- **Manual writes (seeding, corrections):** stop the control plane, write with the plain `sqlite3` CLI, start it again. This is the pattern the qualification harness uses (`scripts/integration/qual/deploy.sh` seeds in a stop→write→restart window).

### Restore from Backup

```bash
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane chv-agent
sudo cp /backup/chv-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db
sudo chown chv:chv /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
# Re-enroll the local agent if certificates were rotated
```

### Certificate Backup

```bash
sudo tar czf /backup/chv-certs-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /etc/chv/certs/
```

### Disaster Recovery Runbooks

For detailed step-by-step procedures covering VM snapshot restore, volume snapshot restore, backup artifact restore, control plane DR, and full site recovery, see the runbooks in [`docs/runbooks/`](runbooks/).

| Runbook | Scenario |
|---------|----------|
| [VM Snapshot Restore](runbooks/vm-snapshot-restore.md) | Restore a VM from a local snapshot (automated) |
| [Volume Snapshot Restore](runbooks/volume-snapshot-restore.md) | Restore a volume from a local snapshot (local/Ceph automated; LVM/iSCSI manual) |
| [Backup Artifact Restore](runbooks/backup-artifact-restore.md) | Restore a VM from a shipped S3/NFS backup artifact (manual) |
| [Control Plane DR](runbooks/control-plane-dr.md) | Recover the control plane after host failure or DB corruption |
| [Full Site Recovery](runbooks/full-site-recovery.md) | Rebuild the entire infrastructure from backups |

## Scaling: Multi-Node

> **Qualification status:** Multi-node operation is unqualified. The enrollment
> protocol is code-supported, but control-plane dispatch resolves a local
> Unix-socket path and cannot drive a remote node. The qualified topology is
> single-host.

### Add a hypervisor-only node

1. **On the control plane host**, create a bootstrap token:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   echo "$TOKEN" | sudo tee /etc/chv/bootstrap.token.new
   # Insert into DB (one-time use)
   ```

2. **On the new hypervisor node**, install binaries and Cloud Hypervisor (the VMM):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm bridge-utils iproute2 iptables
   # Copy chv-agent, chv-stord, chv-nwd from the control plane host
   ```

3. Configure `/etc/chv/agent.toml`:
   ```toml
   control_plane_addr = "https://<CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:8443"
   # ... other settings same as all-in-one deploy
   ```

4. Start services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now chv-stord chv-nwd chv-agent
   ```

5. **Verify enrollment** in the Web UI or via API:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/nodes | jq '.items[].name'
   ```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Agent Fails to Enroll
| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Bootstrap token exists | `sudo cat /etc/chv/bootstrap.token` |
| Token not expired | `sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" "SELECT expires_at FROM bootstrap_tokens;"` |
| Control plane listening | `ss -tlnp | grep 8443` |
| Agent can reach control plane | `curl -k https://127.0.0.1:8443/health` |
| Agent logs | `journalctl -u chv-agent -n 100 --no-pager` |

### VM Won't Start
| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| KVM available | `ls /dev/kvm && groups chv` |
| Cloud Hypervisor binary | `cloud-hypervisor --version` |
| Storage pool exists | `ls /var/lib/chv/storage/localdisk/` |
| Volume prepared by stord | `journalctl -u chv-stord -n 50` |
| Network bridge up | `ip addr show chvbr0` |

### Web UI Blank or API Errors
| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Blank page | Verify `/opt/chv/ui/index.html` exists; check `nginx -T \| grep root` |
| JSON parse error | Ensure nginx `proxy_pass` has NO trailing slash after the port |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Verify control plane is running: `systemctl status chv-controlplane` |
| Console disconnected | Check WebSocket proxy config; verify agent PTY process is running |

### chv-stord or chv-nwd Keep Restarting
| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Binary permissions | `ls -l $(command -v chv-stord chv-nwd)` |
| Socket directory | `ls -la /run/chv/stord /run/chv/nwd` |
| Config syntax | `cat /etc/chv/stord.toml` / `cat /etc/chv/nwd.toml` |
| Daemon logs | `journalctl -u chv-stord -f` / `journalctl -u chv-nwd -f` |

If the node runs `chv-agent` with `stord_config_path` set in `/etc/chv/agent.toml`
(#385 respawn config fidelity), the agent's supervisor respawns a dead stord with
the operator's `stord.toml` verbatim — every operator key survives the respawn.
An agent log line `stord_config_path unusable for respawn; falling back to the
supervisor-generated config` means the file was unreadable, malformed, or its
`socket_path` did not match the agent's `stord_socket`: the respawned daemon
then runs the minimal generated config (allowlist per
`stord_path_allowlist`, `runtime_dir` under the agent's data dir) and any
operator keys — `backend_type`, `device_allowlist`, `[migration]`, a custom
`runtime_dir` — are NOT in effect until the file is fixed. The agent user must
be able to read the file (both standard install surfaces grant this via
`chv-stord` group membership: `install.sh` and the `.deb` postinst; note the
timing on package upgrades — the postinst never restarts the agent, so the
grant takes effect at the agent's next start; hardening `stord.toml` before
that restart yields the warn + fallback above until then);
hand-managed deployments should set `stord_config_path` to their
`stord.toml` to get the pass-through behavior.

A `stord.toml` that passes that check can still fail at daemon *startup*: a
missing or unwritable `runtime_dir` parent (stord aborts when it cannot create
its session store), a backend constructor with bad material (e.g. an LVM volume
group that does not exist), or migration TLS files that stord validates when
the listener comes up rather than at parse time. In that case the respawned
stord exits immediately and the supervisor re-validates the file (it still
parses and the socket still matches) and re-execs the operator path on its
normal restart throttle (~5 s): it does **not** fall back to the generated
config, because the fallback covers validation failures only. This mirrors
systemd `Restart=on-failure` restarting `ExecStart=chv-stord /etc/chv/stord.toml`
with the same broken file — the remedy is the same in both cases: fix the
operator config (create/widen the `runtime_dir`, repair the backend or TLS
material). The health check is never wedged: the agent keeps reporting stord
unhealthy and keeps retrying under the throttle while the file is broken.

### LVM Storage Nodes (#379)

A node serves LVM volumes when its stord runs `backend_type = "lvm"`. The
operator contract:

**1. Provision the VG out-of-band — stord never creates it.**

```bash
pvcreate /dev/nvme0n1
vgcreate chv-vg /dev/nvme0n1
```

**2. Configure stord, and point the agent at the same file.** In
`/etc/chv/stord.toml`:

```toml
backend_type = "lvm"
lvm_volume_group = "chv-vg"          # default when unset
device_allowlist = ["/dev/dm-*", "/dev/mapper/*"]
```

and in `/etc/chv/agent.toml`, `stord_config_path = "/etc/chv/stord.toml"`
(the #385 pass-through key — it makes supervisor respawns keep the LVM shape,
and it is the SAME file the agent parses at startup to learn the node's real
backend class for inventory reporting and LVM locator shaping). **Changing the
backend requires an agent restart**: the agent parses `stord_config_path` once
at startup, so flipping `backend_type` without restarting the agent leaves it
reporting and dispatching against the old class.

**3. Fail-closed startup guards (by design).** stord aborts at startup rather
than serving the wrong backend: a present-but-unrecognized `backend_type`
(e.g. a typo'd `"lvv"`) aborts with `backend_type '…' is not a recognized stord
backend`, and `backend_type = "lvm"` against a VG that does not exist (or a
host without `vgs`) aborts with `backend_type is 'lvm' but volume group '…'
does not exist`. An *absent* `backend_type` still means `local` — the default
contract is unchanged.

**4. Volume opens are dm-path-shaped and allowlist-checked.** The agent opens
LVM-class volumes with a `/dev/mapper/{vg}-{volume_id}` locator token; the
`device_allowlist` check fires only for `lvm`/`block`-class opens, so the
recommended allowlist above admits exactly those tokens while a VM-dir path
(`{volume_id}.img`) is denied. Omitting `device_allowlist` leaves device opens
unconfined (fail-open) — set it explicitly on LVM nodes.

**5. Provisioning is create-on-open; seeding is out-of-band.** An open of an
**absent** LV with a size provisions it (`lvcreate`, sized from the volume's
capacity — a VM's boot disk carries its `volume_size_gb`); an open of an absent
LV *without* a size is rejected (`size_bytes`), and so is any `seed_from`
(`InvalidArgument` — LVM has no seed path by design). To place an image on an
LV, seed it out-of-band while the VM is stopped:

```bash
qemu-img convert -O raw /var/lib/chv/images/noble.raw /dev/chv-vg/<volume_id>
```

**6. Reclamation is out-of-band.** Deleting the VM closes the stord session
but never removes the LV — reclaim capacity with
`lvremove /dev/chv-vg/<volume_id>` once the data is no longer wanted.

**7. Class mismatches are rejected at accept time.** The node's inventory
reports the real backend class (from the parsed `stord_config_path`), and the
control plane rejects a VM create or volume attach requesting a class the node
does not offer (`400`, before any intent is journaled). A NULL/absent class
still means `local` everywhere. A node that has not reported classes (no
inventory yet, or a pre-#379 agent) is never rejected by this check — the
agent's volume open and stord's own backend validation remain the enforcement.

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| VG exists and has free space | `vgs chv-vg` |
| stord running the LVM backend | `journalctl -u chv-stord \| grep backend_type` |
| Node reports the class | `chvctl node list` (storage classes in node detail) |
| LV materialized for a VM volume | `lvs chv-vg` |
| Agent failed to parse the config | `journalctl -u chv-agent \| grep -i stord_config` (silence is expected on success — the agent logs this key only on the warn/degrade path; "Node reports the class" above is the positive signal) |

### Upgrade Failures

The automated upgrade orchestrator was removed in PR #213, and the `chvctl upgrade` subcommands were removed in #427 — they targeted `/v1/upgrades` BFF routes that were never registered. There is no automated upgrade surface to troubleshoot; upgrades are performed manually (see "Upgrade Procedure (Manual)" below). If a manual binary swap leaves a node drained, force it back to a healthy state:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/nodes/mutate \
  -d '{"node_id": "<NODE_ID>", "action": "exit_maintenance"}'
```

### Migration Failures

| Symptom | Diagnostic | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION: no migration client identity` | Sender node has no migration client identity configured (migration disabled, or a destination-only stord) | This node does not initiate migrations. Set `migration.client_cert_path`, `migration.client_key_path`, `migration.ca_cert_path`, and `migration.dest_server_name` with `migration.enabled = true` in `/etc/chv/stord.toml` **only if this node should send migrations** — a destination-only stord legitimately has no client identity |
| `failed to connect to peer with mTLS` | Certificate mismatch or network issue | Verify CA cert matches on both nodes; check firewall rules |
| `CRC mismatch reported by receiver` | Data corruption in transit | Check network for packet corruption; retry migration |
| `deadline_exceeded waiting for Ack` | Receiver not acknowledging | Check receiver node health; disk I/O saturation on destination |
| Migration stuck (reaper will clean up) | `chv_migration_phase` gauge stuck | Wait for reaper (2h timeout) or manually fail: update `migrations` table |
| Backpressure throttling | `slow_down_factor` in logs | Receiver is overwhelmed; reduce concurrent migrations or add I/O capacity |

**Check active migrations:**
```bash
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT migration_id, vm_id, phase, started_at FROM migrations \
   WHERE phase NOT IN ('Completed', 'Failed', 'RolledBack');"
```

**Verify mTLS configuration:**
```bash
# Check cert files exist and are readable
ls -la /etc/chv/certs/node.pem /etc/chv/certs/node-key.pem /etc/chv/certs/ca.pem

# Test TLS handshake to a peer
openssl s_client -connect <PEER_IP>:8444 \
  -cert /etc/chv/certs/node.pem \
  -key /etc/chv/certs/node-key.pem \
  -CAfile /etc/chv/certs/ca.pem
```

### Stuck Operations After Agent Crash (InspectRequired)

When the agent process dies while a Core operation is in flight, the next
startup durably marks that operation **InspectRequired** and quarantines its
VM: the executor will not touch the VM again until an operator resolves the
operation. This is fail-closed — the side effect may or may not have happened.

**Recognize it:**

- Agent log at startup: `restart classification marked running operations InspectRequired`
- Scan-time log on any change: `journal scan: inspect-required operations changed`
- Agent metrics (`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics`, core-managed mode
  only): `chv_agent_journal_inspect_required` (current stuck count),
  `chv_agent_journal_healthy` (0 while the journal scanner is wedged)
- Node-local Core API:
  ```bash
  curl -s --unix-socket /run/chv/core/core-v1.sock http://localhost/v1/operations
  ```
  Stuck operations are `status: "running"` **plus** a `recovery_assessment`
  field; in-flight operations are `running` without it.

**Resolve it** — two equivalent paths. Node-local (works even when the
control plane cannot reach the node):

```bash
grpcurl -unix /run/chv/agent/api.sock \
  chv.controlplane.node.v1.LifecycleService/ResolveInspectRequiredOperation \
  -d '{
    "meta": {
      "operation_id": "resolve-<operation_id>",
      "requested_by": "operator-name"
    },
    "operation_id": "<from /v1/operations>",
    "vm_id": "<the operation's vm_id>",
    "disposition": "succeeded",
    "note": "VM is running and healthy; start completed before the crash"
  }'
```

Or via the control plane's relay (no node login required: the control
plane forwards to the owning agent, which validates and
terminal-persists; if the agent socket is unreachable the call fails
with `UNAVAILABLE` and the node-local path above is the fallback). The
target node goes in `meta.target_node_id`. The control plane's gRPC
surface requires mTLS — every request must present a certificate signed
by the control-plane CA (the same requirement as every other node-facing
RPC). The installed agent client certificate works:

```bash
grpcurl \
  -cacert /etc/chv/certs/ca.crt \
  -cert /etc/chv/certs/agent-client.crt \
  -key /etc/chv/certs/agent-client.key \
  127.0.0.1:8443 \
  chv.controlplane.node.v1.LifecycleService/ResolveInspectRequiredOperation \
  -d '{
    "meta": {
      "operation_id": "<operation_id>",
      "requested_by": "operator-name",
      "target_node_id": "<owning node id>"
    },
    "operation_id": "<from /v1/operations>",
    "vm_id": "<the operation's vm_id>",
    "disposition": "succeeded",
    "note": "VM is running and healthy; start completed before the crash"
  }'
```

Use `"disposition": "succeeded"` when the real-world state matches the
operation's intent (e.g. the VM is actually running after a stuck start), and
`"failed"` when it does not. The resolution terminal-persists the operation
under its original attempt token, is replay-idempotent (safe to retry), and
the VM is un-quarantined on the next executor scan. The note must state what
was observed and how it was verified — it is recorded in the journal.

## Maintenance Windows

### Graceful Node Drain

Draining a node evacuates all VMs via live migration before allowing maintenance.

> **Qualification status:** The drain machinery is code-supported but
> unqualified; no multi-host evidence exists.

**Via CLI:**
```bash
chvctl node drain <NODE_ID>
```

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/nodes/mutate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"node_id": "<NODE_ID>", "action": "drain"}'
```

**What happens:**
1. Node transitions to `Draining` — scheduling is paused immediately
2. Agent reconcile loop issues migration requests for each running VM.
   **Core-managed mode:** the agent is observe-only and issues **no**
   migration requests — the control plane must re-home the VMs. While any
   desired-Running VM (or an undecodable fragment) remains, the agent blocks
   the `Maintenance` transition and raises a `drain_blocked` control-plane
   alert (on change, not per tick).
3. VMs are live-migrated to other `TenantReady` nodes (legacy mode), or
   re-homed by the control plane (core-managed mode)
4. When all VMs are evacuated, node transitions to `Maintenance` automatically
5. Perform maintenance (kernel update, hardware swap, etc.)
6. Restart agent: `sudo systemctl start chv-agent`
7. Mark node ready: set desired state to `TenantReady` via API or Web UI

**Monitor drain progress:**
```bash
# Check remaining VMs
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM vms v JOIN vm_observed_state o ON v.vm_id = o.vm_id \
   WHERE v.node_id = '<NODE_ID>' AND o.runtime_status NOT IN ('Stopped', 'Deleted');"

# Watch via metrics
watch -n5 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_node_vm_count'
```

### Rolling Upgrade

> **Status:** No automated rolling-upgrade surface exists. The control-plane
> upgrade stack (`UpgradeOrchestrator`, `SystemdNodeUpgrader`) was deleted as
> dead code in PR #213, and the `chvctl upgrade` subcommands — which targeted
> `/v1/upgrades` BFF routes that were never registered — were removed in #427.
> Use the manual procedure below ("Upgrade Procedure (Manual)") together with
> `chvctl node drain` to upgrade nodes one at a time.

### Compatibility Matrix

The compatibility matrix defines allowed version ranges per component. Located at `/etc/chv/compat-matrix.toml`:

```toml
[compatibility]
[[compatibility.entry]]
component = "agent"
min_version = "0.1.0"
max_version = "1.0.0"

[[compatibility.entry]]
component = "stord"
min_version = "0.2.0"
max_version = "1.0.0"
```

**Check compatibility via API:**
```bash
chvctl health cluster
```

The control plane validates the matrix at upgrade time. If the target version falls outside the allowed range, the upgrade is rejected before any drain begins.

### Upgrade Procedure (Manual)

1. Back up database and certificates
2. Build or download new release tarball
3. Stop services in order: agent → stord/nwd → control plane
4. Install new binaries
5. Start control plane (runs migrations automatically)
6. Start stord and nwd
7. Start agent
8. Verify: `systemctl status` and `curl /health`

### Migration Monitoring

Key Prometheus metrics to watch during live migration:

| Metric | Type | What it tells you |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| `chv_migration_phase` | Gauge | Current phase (0=Pending, 1=PreCopyDisk, 2=ConvergingDisk, 3=MemoryMigration, 4=Paused, 5=Completed, 6=Failed, 7=RolledBack) |
| `chv_migration_bytes_transferred` | Counter | Total bytes copied so far |
| `chv_migration_duration_seconds` | Histogram | End-to-end migration time by outcome |
| `chv_migration_dirty_blocks` | Gauge | Remaining dirty blocks during convergence |

**Expected phase durations** (100GB disk, 16GB RAM):

| Phase | Typical | Alarm threshold |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| PreCopyDisk | 10-60 min | >90 min |
| ConvergingDisk | 1-10 min per round | >30 min total |
| MemoryMigration | 30s-5 min | >10 min |
| Paused (final sync) | <5s | >30s |

**When to intervene:**

- `dirty_blocks` not converging after 5 rounds: check I/O write rate on source VM
- Phase stuck in MemoryMigration >10 min: possible network partition between nodes
- Migration rolled back repeatedly: check source/destination connectivity and disk I/O saturation

```bash
# Check active migrations
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT migration_id, vm_id, phase, bytes_transferred, dirty_blocks_remaining \
   FROM migrations WHERE completed_at IS NULL;"

# Watch migration progress
watch -n5 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_migration'
```

### VXLAN Overlay Troubleshooting

> **Status:** The VXLAN/WireGuard fabric fails closed in the qualified
> configuration. The qualified network topology is a single-host local
> bridge with taps.

| Symptom | Diagnostic | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Stale FDB entries | `bridge fdb show dev vxlan<VNI>` | Trigger reconcile: restart chv-agent on affected node |
| VXLAN interface down | `ip link show \| grep vxlan` | Check `chv-nwd` logs; verify VTEP registration in DB |
| VNI exhaustion | `sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" "SELECT count(*) FROM vni_allocations WHERE released_at IS NULL;"` | Release unused VNIs or expand VNI range |
| Cross-node VM unreachable | `tcpdump -i <vtep_interface> udp port 4789` | Verify UDP/4789 not blocked by firewall between nodes |
| MTU issues / fragmentation | `ping -M do -s 1400 <remote_vm_ip>` | Check `[overlay] inner_mtu` in nwd.toml; ensure outer MTU >= inner + 50 |

```bash
# Verify VTEP registry
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT node_id, vtep_ip, vtep_port FROM vtep_entries;"

# Check VNI allocation for a network
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT network_id, vni, allocated_at FROM vni_allocations WHERE network_id = '<ID>';"

# Force overlay reconciliation on a node
systemctl restart chv-nwd
```

### eBPF Policy Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Diagnostic | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Program load failure | `journalctl -u chv-nwd \| grep "eBPF"` | Verify `/usr/lib/chv/ebpf/policy_tc.o` exists; check kernel version >= 5.10 |
| Rules not applied | `tc filter show dev <tap> egress` | Check that clsact qdisc is attached; verify rule_map entries |
| Stats all zeros | `journalctl -u chv-nwd \| grep "stats_map"` | eBPF programs may be in stub mode (libbpf-rs not available) |
| VM traffic blocked unexpectedly | Check `chv_ebpf_packets_total{action="denied"}` metric | Review security rules via API; check default_action in `[ebpf]` config |
| Rate limiting too aggressive | Check `chv_ebpf_bytes_total` vs configured rate | Adjust rate_bps in the VM's rate limit policy |

```bash
# Check if eBPF programs are loaded on a tap interface
tc filter show dev tap-<vm_short_id> egress

# View eBPF stats (via metrics endpoint)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9901/metrics | grep chv_ebpf

# Verify eBPF object files exist
ls -la /usr/lib/chv/ebpf/policy_tc.o
```

### Backup & Recovery for Multi-Node State

The SQLite backup (see above) automatically includes all multi-node state:

- **VTEP registry**: `vtep_entries` table (node-to-VTEP-IP mapping)
- **VNI allocations**: `vni_allocations` table (network-to-VNI mapping with cooldown)
- **Migration records**: `migrations` table (active and completed migrations)
- **FDB state**: Reconstructed at recovery time from VTEP registry + VM placement

**Recovery procedure for overlay state:**

1. Restore SQLite backup (standard procedure above)
2. Restart control plane: `sudo systemctl restart chv-controlplane`
3. Restart agents on all nodes: `sudo systemctl restart chv-agent`
4. Agents will re-register VTEPs and control plane will reconcile overlay state
5. Verify: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/nodes | jq '.[].vtep_ip'`

**If overlay state is corrupt but VMs are running:**

```bash
# VMs continue running with stale FDB — connectivity may be intermittent
# Force full overlay rebuild (stop the control plane first — see
# Live Database Access):
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db "DELETE FROM vtep_entries;"
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
# Then restart all agents to re-register
```

## Security Hardening

- Replace self-signed CA with organization PKI
- Rotate bootstrap tokens after each use
- Restrict `/etc/chv/certs/` to `root:chv` with `640` permissions
- Run `chv-stord` under a dedicated service account with device/path allowlists
- Enable firewall rules limiting gRPC port 8443 to known hypervisor IPs

## Architecture Designer day-2 operations

The Architecture Designer (see [`docs/specs/architecture-designer/`](specs/architecture-designer/)) persists desired-state topologies, plans, apply runs, drift reports, and fleet inventory snapshots in the controlplane SQLite database. Day-2 ops mirror the rest of CHV: SQLite backups + targeted retention.

### Backup

The Architecture Designer ships six tables (migrations `0046`–`0051`):

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `architecture_topologies` | Saved topology metadata (id, name, owner, latest version pointer) |
| `architecture_versions` | Immutable, append-only history of every saved YAML revision |
| `architecture_plans` | Generated plans pending or completed (apply / destroy modes) |
| `architecture_apply_runs` | Apply / destroy execution records linked to CHV tasks |
| `architecture_drift_reports` | Drift findings per architecture per check |
| `inventory_snapshots` | Fleet observed state captured for plan determinism and drift baselines |

The standard SQLite backup procedure documented earlier (`sqlite3 ... ".backup"`) covers all six tables — they live in `/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db` along with everything else. No separate dump is required.

**Recommended cadence:**
- Hourly online backup retained 24h.
- Daily backup retained 30d.
- Weekly off-host backup retained 12 months.

**Recovery posture:**
- **RPO** ≤ 1 hour (last hourly backup).
- **RTO** ≤ 15 minutes for control-plane restore (stop service → copy file → start) on a single-node deployment.
- A restored database loses any plans / apply runs created after the backup window. Topologies and accepted versions are unaffected if backups are taken before user-facing edits.

### Starter topologies — opt-out and re-seed

On first boot the controlplane seeds six canonical reference topologies into `architecture_topologies` (see [`docs/plans/2026-06-16-starter-topologies-and-auto-seed.md`](plans/2026-06-16-starter-topologies-and-auto-seed.md)). They land as `status = draft`, `owner_user_id = NULL`, named `starter-NN-<slug>`, and the dashboard never auto-applies them — operators clone, not edit, starters to make their own.

The seed is gated by a sentinel row `seed_starters_completed` in `system_settings`. A single atomic `UPSERT … WHERE value = '0'` flips the sentinel to `'1'` and claims the seed; only the process whose UPDATE affects exactly one row owns the run. Subsequent boots see `value = '1'` and skip cleanly.

**Opt out before first boot** (e.g. on a real production deployment where the operator does not want demo content):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db \
  "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO system_settings (key, value, updated_at)
   VALUES ('seed_starters_completed', '1', strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ','now'));"
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
# verify: dashboard shows zero topologies; controlplane logs note "starter topologies already seeded; skipping"
```

**Re-seed missing starters** (operator deleted some starter rows and wants them back):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db \
  "UPDATE system_settings SET value = '0',
       updated_at = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ','now')
   WHERE key = 'seed_starters_completed';"
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
# the seeder's per-starter AlreadyExists branch means existing rows are left untouched;
# only the missing ones get re-inserted. The sentinel flips back to '1' on success.
```

**Caveats:**
- The sentinel must be exactly `'0'` to trigger re-seed. Trailing whitespace (`'0 '`) does NOT match — by design, to keep typo-resistant operator overrides idempotent.
- A control plane that cannot read or write `system_settings` refuses to start. Sentinel-write failures are fail-closed; per-fixture parse/insert failures are fail-open and logged via `tracing::error!` so a single bad fixture does not block boot.

### Retention

Until the periodic pruner ships (tracked in [`docs/plans/2026-06-16-snapshot-pruner-followup.md`](plans/2026-06-16-snapshot-pruner-followup.md)), retention is best-effort and operator-driven. Recommended policy:

| Table | Retention | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `architecture_topologies` | Indefinite | Small, user-curated, no churn. |
| `architecture_versions` | Indefinite | Append-only history of intent; per ADR-003-Designer the YAML is the source of truth. Small. |
| `architecture_plans` | 30 days post-terminal status | Per ADR-005-Designer; expired/discarded plans are not re-runnable. Active plans never deleted. |
| `architecture_apply_runs` | 90d for `succeeded`, indefinite for `failed`/`partially_failed` | Failed runs are audit material. Successful runs are operational telemetry. |
| `architecture_drift_reports` | 14 days, **but** retain latest report per architecture indefinitely | Most recent report is the user-facing "current drift" view. |
| `inventory_snapshots` | 7 days | High churn; only the recent ones drive plan determinism. |

Operators who need to free space before the pruner ships can run targeted
deletes (stop the control plane first — manual writes to the live database
are unsafe; see [Live Database Access](#live-database-access)):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
# Drop drift reports older than 14 days, keeping the latest per architecture
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db <<'SQL'
DELETE FROM architecture_drift_reports
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT id FROM (
        SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY architecture_id ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS rn
        FROM architecture_drift_reports
    ) WHERE rn = 1
)
AND created_at < datetime('now', '-14 days');
SQL

# Drop inventory snapshots older than 7 days
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db \
  "DELETE FROM inventory_snapshots WHERE created_at < datetime('now', '-7 days');"

sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
```

Always take a backup before manual deletes, and stop the control plane
before writing (see [Live Database Access](#live-database-access)).

### Monitoring

The Architecture Designer exposes Prometheus metrics on the controlplane `:9901/metrics` endpoint. The label vocabularies below match the actual emitter source (`crates/chv-webui-bff/src/metrics_apply.rs` and `metrics_drift.rs`); writing alerts against label values the emitter does not produce yields silent dead-on-arrival rules.

```
# Apply attempts (counter)
# status ∈ { started, enqueued, failed }
#   - started:  incremented on every POST /v1/architectures/apply entry,
#               before pre-condition guards run
#   - enqueued: apply_plan returned Ok and the run was accepted for execution
#   - failed:   apply_plan returned Err (4xx pre-condition or 5xx store)
# Note: this counter records the BFF-side enqueue lifecycle. Terminal
# orchestrator outcomes (succeeded / partially_failed / cancelled) are
# recorded in the `architecture_apply_runs.status` column today; a future
# emitter on the orchestrator terminal-state writeback can extend this
# counter or introduce `chv_architecture_apply_terminal_total`.
chv_architecture_apply_total{status="started|enqueued|failed"}

# Apply latency (histogram, BFF handler entry → response)
chv_architecture_apply_duration_seconds_bucket{...}

# Drift checks (counter)
# status ∈ { no_drift, drifted, unknown, check_failed, cache_hit }
#   - no_drift:     fresh compute returned an empty findings list
#   - drifted:      fresh compute returned at least one finding
#   - unknown:      reserved for the wire enum's DriftStatus::Unknown variant
#   - check_failed: snapshot capture or YAML parse failed; the BFF persisted
#                   a check_failed report and returned 200
#   - cache_hit:    the most recent persisted report was within the 5-minute
#                   TTL and force_refresh was false
chv_architecture_drift_total{status="no_drift|drifted|unknown|check_failed|cache_hit"}
```

Recommended alert templates (Prometheus `for:` durations are starting points; tune per environment):

```yaml
- alert: ArchitectureDriftCheckFailing
  expr: increase(chv_architecture_drift_total{status="check_failed"}[5m]) > 0
  for: 5m
  labels: { severity: page }
  annotations:
    summary: "Architecture drift checker is failing"
    description: "Drift checks have returned check_failed in the last 5 minutes — fleet visibility is degraded."

- alert: ArchitectureApplySlow
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(chv_architecture_apply_duration_seconds_bucket[15m])) > 600
  for: 15m
  labels: { severity: ticket }
  annotations:
    summary: "Architecture apply p99 > 10 minutes"
    description: "Apply runs are taking longer than expected; investigate task-system backlog."

- alert: ArchitectureApplyEnqueueFailureRate
  # `failed` here is the BFF enqueue-time failure (pre-condition or store);
  # it does NOT cover orchestrator-side terminal failures because those are
  # not surfaced as a Prometheus counter today (see Monitoring note above).
  expr: |
    sum(rate(chv_architecture_apply_total{status="failed"}[15m]))
      / clamp_min(sum(rate(chv_architecture_apply_total{status=~"started|failed"}[15m])), 1e-9) > 0.2
  for: 30m
  labels: { severity: ticket }
  annotations:
    summary: "Architecture apply enqueue failure rate > 20% over 15m"
    description: >
      More than 20% of POST /v1/architectures/apply requests are failing the
      pre-condition or store guard. For terminal orchestrator outcomes
      (succeeded / partially_failed / cancelled), query
      `architecture_apply_runs` directly until a dedicated counter ships.
```

> **Label-vocabulary contract**: the bundled rules in `monitoring/rules/chv.yml` and `recording.yml` reference only labels the emitter actually sets. CI runs `scripts/check-metric-labels.sh` on every push to enforce that contract — see [`docs/specs/adr/009-logging-and-observability.md`](specs/adr/009-logging-and-observability.md). If you extend an emitter to add a new label key, run the gate locally before opening the PR.

### Troubleshooting

**Drift checks return `CheckFailed` repeatedly**

| Diagnostic | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| `journalctl -u chv-controlplane \| grep architecture_drift` for the underlying error | Most common cause: a referenced resource (network, datastore) was deleted out-of-band. Re-pin the architecture's baseline by re-running `apply` after editing the topology, or accept the current drift by writing a new version. |
| Inventory snapshot stale (look for `inventory_snapshots.created_at` > 1h old) | Restart the controlplane snapshot loop: `systemctl restart chv-controlplane`. The next drift check uses a fresh snapshot. |

**Apply stuck in `Applying` state**

The apply state machine uses CAS guards (compare-and-set on `status`) to ensure exactly one writer. A stuck `Applying` row usually means the worker process died mid-run.

```bash
# Inspect the run
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT id, architecture_id, plan_id, status, started_at, updated_at \
   FROM architecture_apply_runs WHERE status = 'applying';"

# Check that no live task is still in flight
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT operation_id, kind, state FROM operations \
   WHERE meta_json LIKE '%<APPLY_RUN_ID>%';"
```

If the linked task is `Failed` / `Cancelled` and no controlplane process is holding the row (no recent `updated_at`), reset the run to `failed` so a retry is possible (stop the control plane first — see [Live Database Access](#live-database-access)):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db <<SQL
UPDATE architecture_apply_runs
SET status = 'failed',
    error_summary = 'manual recovery: stuck applying',
    updated_at = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now')
WHERE id = '<APPLY_RUN_ID>' AND status = 'applying';
SQL
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
```

The CAS guard makes this safe: if a live worker still owns the row, the `WHERE status = 'applying'` clause races the update without corrupting state. Always restart the controlplane first if there is any doubt.

**Plan returns `PLAN_EXPIRED` on retry within 15 minutes**

Plans expire 15 minutes after generation (per ADR-005-Designer). If a fresh plan is rejected as expired, suspect clock skew between the BFF process and the controlplane.

| Diagnostic | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| `date -u` on each host running CHV components | Sync clocks: `sudo chronyc -a makestep` or `sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd`. |
| Inspect the plan row: `SELECT created_at, expires_at FROM architecture_plans WHERE id = '<PLAN_ID>';` | If `expires_at - created_at` is not 15 minutes, the issuing process has wrong wall-clock; restart that process after the clock fix. |
| Container deployments with shared host clock | Verify NTP is enabled on the host; containers inherit host time, so a host-level fix propagates. |

If clocks are correct and the plan still expires immediately, file a bug — the controlplane and BFF should always agree on plan expiry.
