# CHV Deployment Guide — All-in-One Host

This guide deploys CHV on a single Linux host. The host runs the **control plane** (orchestration, API, Web UI) and Cloud Hypervisor (the VMM) as the VM runtime.

> **Version:** 0.3.0  
> **Target:** Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS or equivalent Linux with KVM support  
> **Database:** SQLite (no external database service required)

## Quick Start (One-Liner Install)

Run the official installer on a fresh Ubuntu server with root access:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.cellhv.com/ | sh -
```

Or install a specific version:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.cellhv.com/ | INSTALL_CHV_VERSION=<version> sh -
```

**Network defaults** (override with environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_NAME` | `chvbr0` | Linux bridge name |
| `INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_CIDR` | `10.200.0.1/24` | Gateway IP / subnet |
| `INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_IFACE` | `ens19` | Host interface attached to bridge (NAT upstream) |

Example with custom network:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.cellhv.com/ | \
  INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_IFACE=eth0 \
  INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_CIDR=192.168.100.1/24 \
  sh -
```

The installer will:

1. Install system dependencies (`nginx`, `qemu-kvm`, `bridge-utils`, `iptables`, etc.)
2. Download and install CHV binaries, Web UI assets, and database migrations
3. Download and install the Cloud Hypervisor VMM
4. Generate a self-signed TLS CA
5. Create and configure the `chvbr0` bridge with NAT
6. Write `controlplane.toml`, `agent.toml`, `stord.toml`, and `nwd.toml`
7. Install systemd services for all four CHV daemons
8. Create a one-time bootstrap token (saved to `/etc/chv/bootstrap.token`)
9. Configure nginx to serve the Web UI and proxy API calls
10. Start all services and wait for the local agent to enroll as a compute node

After ~60 seconds, open the printed IP address in your browser.  
Default login: **admin / (random password)**. The bootstrap password is written
to `/etc/chv/initial_admin_password` (mode 0600, root-owned) and printed once
in the install output. You will be required to change it on first login.

## Quick Install (single command, from GitHub releases)

> **Deployment status:** [CODE-SUPPORTED, UNQUALIFIED]. This path has no
> qualification leg yet — no m4.x campaign or container smoke test
> exercises it. It shares install.sh's conventions (users, `/etc/chv`
> layout, systemd units, chown discipline) but rides the #447
> package-serving shape. `scripts/install.sh` remains the qualified
> deployment path.

A curl-pipe-bash installer for trying CHV on a fresh Linux host — one
command yields the control plane with the WebUI served by the binary
itself (#447 D3 shape — `[webui]` enabled, **no nginx involved**), plus
the local agent enrolled against it (`chv-agent` + `chv-stord` +
`chv-nwd`), systemd units, and config under `/etc/chv`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedoio/chv/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | sudo bash -s
```

Or pinned to a tagged release, with a dry run available:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedoio/chv/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --version 0.3.0
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubedoio/chv/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --dry-run
```

The script (`scripts/quick-install.sh`, issue #482) resolves the latest
**stable** tagged release via the GitHub API (nightly is deliberately not
supported), detects architecture (amd64/arm64) and distro family
(.deb on Debian-family, .rpm on RH-family, release tarball fallback
elsewhere), downloads the matching release assets, and verifies them
against the release's `SHA256SUMS` (packages) or the tarball's `.sha256`
sidecar — a missing asset or checksum mismatch aborts before anything is
installed. It then installs the artifacts, generates TLS material and
`/etc/chv/*.toml`, seeds the bootstrap token (via the loopback-only
`/internal/bootstrap-token` route) and the bootstrap admin user, enables
and starts the four systemd services, and waits for the local agent's
enrollment.

After it completes, open `http://<host-ip>:8080/` and log in as
**admin** with the password from `/etc/chv/initial_admin_password`
(printed once, mode 0600, root-only; rotation is forced on first login).

### Disclosed judgments and limits

- **`http_bind` is `0.0.0.0:8080`, plain HTTP.** With no nginx edge, the
  control plane's own listener is the only front door. Static assets are
  unauthenticated by design (the login page must load); every API route
  keeps its auth. Do not expose this port to untrusted networks — put an
  edge proxy in front (see "Serving the Web UI in package mode") if you
  need TLS or remote access with a hardened posture.
- **The serial console (`/ws/`) does not work on this path.** The control
  plane binary does not proxy `/ws/` (the #447 decision,
  maintainer-ratified 2026-10-07) and this path installs no edge. VM
  lifecycle works from the WebUI; the console needs an edge proxy.
- **arm64 hosts fail closed today.** The script is arm64-ready (it
  resolves `linux-arm64` asset names), but the release pipeline currently
  publishes linux-amd64 assets only — on an arm64 host the script aborts
  with that explanation rather than half-installing.
- **Idempotency.** A re-run upgrades artifacts in place; config under
  `/etc/chv`, certs, the database, and the bootstrap/admin secrets are
  never overwritten. An existing deployment this script did not configure
  (packages deployed by hand, or `install.sh`) is refused unless `--force`
  is given — `install.sh`'s `/opt/chv/ui` layout and nginx edge are never
  silently converted. A control-plane database without configuration (a
  partial or hand-managed state) is likewise refused unless `--force`:
  fresh config would mint a new `jwt_secret` against a live database and
  invalidate existing sessions and agent tokens.
- **Uninstall.** `sudo scripts/quick-install.sh --uninstall` removes the
  software and preserves `/etc/chv` and `/var/lib/chv`;
  `--uninstall --purge` also removes data and config (the `chv` and
  `chv-stord` users are retained, matching
  [docs/install/uninstall.md](install/uninstall.md)).
- **No bridge/NAT bootstrap, no base image, no seeded test VM.** This
  path stops at "enrolled node + WebUI". Networks and images are created
  from the WebUI/API (or use the qualified `install.sh` path for its
  dev-resource seeding).

### Tier-label gate

The label stays [CODE-SUPPORTED, UNQUALIFIED] until this path's own
qualification leg passes — the fresh-host end-to-end smoke tracked in
#556 (run the one-liner on a clean Linux host and assert package
install, config generation, service bring-up, agent enrollment, and
WebUI serving), in the same gate shape as the #447 container
package-smoke leg tracked in #549.

## Build & Package a Release

If you are developing CHV or want to host your own installer, use the build script in this repository.

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (`rustup`)
- Node.js 22+ and `npm`
- Ubuntu/Debian build host

### Build the Release Tarball

```bash
# From the repository root
./scripts/build-release.sh
```

This will:
1. Build all Rust binaries in release mode
2. Build the SvelteKit Web UI
3. Assemble a release directory with binaries, UI, migrations, configs, and the installer
4. Create `dist/chv-<VERSION>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
5. Generate a SHA256 checksum

### Install from a Local Build (Dev/Test)

```bash
# Build, uninstall previous version, and reinstall in one step
sudo ./scripts/dev-install.sh

# First-time install (skip uninstall step)
sudo ./scripts/dev-install.sh --no-uninstall

# Override network defaults
sudo INSTALL_CHV_BRIDGE_IFACE=eth0 ./scripts/dev-install.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh
sudo INSTALL_CHV_TARBALL_PATH=dist/chv-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz ./scripts/install.sh
```

---

## Manual Deployment (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to deploy manually or need to customize every step, follow the detailed guide below.

### 1. Prerequisites

#### Hardware
- x86_64 server with **hardware virtualization** (VT-x / AMD-V)
- Minimum 4 cores, 8 GB RAM, 50 GB disk

> These minimums are an unevidenced documentation guideline, not a
> qualification-backed envelope. The qualified deployment host was 16 vCPU
> with 31 GiB RAM; no scale claims are derivable from it.

#### Software
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential curl git pkg-config libssl-dev \
  nginx qemu-kvm bridge-utils iproute2 iptables

# Verify KVM
ls /dev/kvm
```

#### Cloud Hypervisor
```bash
CHV_VERSION="53.0"
CHV_SHA256="448af3d4e59b22c2987f7df94c213ad40fb53a10d437e42b5ee6c4fce7c29ecc"
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/releases/download/v${CHV_VERSION}/cloud-hypervisor-static" \
  -o /usr/local/bin/cloud-hypervisor
echo "${CHV_SHA256}  /usr/local/bin/cloud-hypervisor" | sha256sum -c -
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloud-hypervisor
ln -sf /usr/local/bin/cloud-hypervisor /usr/bin/cloud-hypervisor
cloud-hypervisor --version
```

### 2. Build from Source

```bash
# Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Build binaries
cargo build --workspace --release

# Build UI
cd ui && npm install && npm run build
```

### 3. Host Preparation

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin chv
sudo usermod -aG kvm chv

sudo mkdir -p /etc/chv/certs
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/chv/{cache,images,storage/localdisk}
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/chv
sudo mkdir -p /run/chv/{controlplane,agent,stord,nwd}
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chv/ui
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/chv/migrations

sudo chown -R chv:chv /var/lib/chv /var/log/chv /run/chv
sudo chmod 750 /var/lib/chv /var/log/chv
```

### 4. Install Binaries & Assets

```bash
sudo install -m 755 target/release/chv-controlplane /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m 755 target/release/chv-agent        /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m 755 target/release/chv-stord        /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m 755 target/release/chv-nwd          /usr/local/bin/

sudo cp -r ui/build/* /opt/chv/ui/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/chv/ui

sudo cp -r cmd/chv-controlplane/migrations/* /usr/local/share/chv/migrations/
sudo chown -R chv:chv /usr/local/share/chv/migrations
```

### 5. Bridge and NAT Network Setup

```bash
BRIDGE_NAME="chvbr0"
BRIDGE_CIDR="10.200.0.1/24"
BRIDGE_NET="10.200.0.0/24"
UPSTREAM_IFACE="ens19"

# Create bridge
ip link add name $BRIDGE_NAME type bridge
ip link set $BRIDGE_NAME up
ip addr add $BRIDGE_CIDR dev $BRIDGE_NAME

# Attach upstream interface
ip link set $UPSTREAM_IFACE master $BRIDGE_NAME
ip link set $UPSTREAM_IFACE up

# Enable IP forwarding and NAT
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-chv-forward.conf

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $BRIDGE_NET ! -d $BRIDGE_NET -j MASQUERADE

# Persist iptables
sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

### 6. TLS Setup

```bash
sudo openssl genrsa -out /etc/chv/certs/ca.key 4096
sudo openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key /etc/chv/certs/ca.key \
  -sha256 -days 3650 -out /etc/chv/certs/ca.crt \
  -subj "/O=CHV/CN=chv-ca"

sudo chmod 640 /etc/chv/certs/ca.key
sudo chmod 644 /etc/chv/certs/ca.crt
sudo chown root:chv /etc/chv/certs/ca.key /etc/chv/certs/ca.crt
```

### 8. Credential Encryption Key

The control plane encrypts S3 backup credentials at rest
(AES-256-GCM). Generate the key once and never regenerate it — a
database restored without the matching key cannot read stored
credentials:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'umask 077; printf "CHV_ENCRYPTION_KEY=%s\n" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > /etc/chv/encryption.env'
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/chv/encryption.env
```

`chv-controlplane.service` loads it via `EnvironmentFile`. If the file is
absent (or the key empty), the control plane logs a warning at startup and
stores S3 credentials in **plaintext** — see OPERATIONS.md
"Credential encryption key" for backup and rotation semantics.

### 9. systemd Services

```bash
sudo cp docs/examples/systemd/chv-controlplane.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp docs/examples/systemd/chv-agent.service        /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp docs/examples/systemd/chv-stord.service        /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp docs/examples/systemd/chv-nwd.service          /etc/systemd/system/
# The hardened chv-nwd unit needs /run/netns to exist (root:chv 0770).
# The .deb ships this as a tmpfiles entry; on the tarball/manual path install
# the same entry so it is recreated on every boot, then apply it now:
sudo cp packaging/tmpfiles/chv-node.conf /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/chv-node.conf
sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/chv-node.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Service startup order:
- `chv-controlplane` — starts first (runs migrations, opens SQLite DB)
- `chv-stord` and `chv-nwd` — start independently
- `chv-agent` — starts after all three above are up; enrolls with the control plane

### 10. Bootstrap Token

```bash
BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
printf '%s' "$BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN" | sudo tee /etc/chv/bootstrap.token
sudo chmod 640 /etc/chv/bootstrap.token
sudo chown root:chv /etc/chv/bootstrap.token

# Insert token hash into SQLite database (stop the control plane first —
# manual writes to the live database are unsafe; see OPERATIONS.md
# "Live Database Access")
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
TOKEN_HASH=$(printf '%s' "$BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')
EXPIRES=$(date -u -d "+1 hour" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db \
  "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO bootstrap_tokens
   (token_hash, description, one_time_use, expires_at, created_at)
   VALUES ('${TOKEN_HASH}', 'Manual deploy', 1,
           '${EXPIRES}', strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now'));"
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
```

### 11. Web UI (nginx)

```bash
sudo cp docs/examples/nginx/chv-ui.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/chv
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/chv /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/chv
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 12. Start Services

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-controlplane
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-stord
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-nwd
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-agent
```

## Multi-Node WebSocket Console Routing

> **Deployment status:** Multi-node operation is code-supported but unqualified.
> Control-plane dispatch resolves a local Unix-socket path, so
> control-plane-driven operations cannot reach a remote node. The qualified
> topology is single-host.

When CHV runs on multiple hypervisor nodes, VM serial consoles must be routed to the correct node.  There are two deployment modes.

### Direct Mode

Each node has its `agent_ws_address` column set in the `nodes` table (e.g. `192.168.1.10:8444`).  The backend-for-frontend (BFF) returns a full `ws://` or `wss://` URL and the browser connects directly to the node agent.  This is the simplest setup, but it requires the browser to reach every node on the network.

```bash
# Set a node's WebSocket address (stop the control plane first — manual
# writes to the live database are unsafe; see OPERATIONS.md
# "Live Database Access")
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane
sqlite3 /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db \
  "UPDATE nodes SET agent_ws_address = '192.168.1.10:8444' WHERE node_id = 'node-1';"
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
```

### Proxied Mode (Default)

When `agent_ws_address` is empty (or the client passes `?proxied=true`), the BFF returns a relative path that includes the `node_id`:

```
/ws/vms/{node_id}/{vm_id}/console?token=...
```

nginx strips the `/ws/vms/{node_id}` prefix and forwards the request to the correct agent backend using a static `map`.  This works when nodes are on private networks or the UI is behind a firewall.

#### Configuring nginx for Multi-Node

1. Open `/etc/nginx/sites-available/chv` (copied from `docs/examples/nginx/chv-ui.conf`).

2. Edit the `map $request_uri $ws_backend` block near the top of the file.  Add one line per compute node:

   ```nginx
   map $request_uri $ws_backend {
       default              127.0.0.1:8444;
       ~^/ws/vms/node-1/   192.168.1.10:8444;
       ~^/ws/vms/node-2/   192.168.1.11:8444;
   }
   ```

   The `node_id` value must match the `node_id` stored in the CHV database.

3. Test and reload nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

#### Security Considerations

- Terminate TLS in nginx and set `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` so the BFF generates `wss://` URLs for direct mode.
- In proxied mode, the WebSocket inherits nginx's TLS termination automatically because the browser connects to the same `wss://` origin.
- Do **not** expose agent console ports (`:8444`) to untrusted networks unless you are using direct mode with mTLS or WSS.

#### Scaling Note

The static `map` approach is production-standard for small-to-medium clusters (tens of nodes).  For very large clusters, consider OpenResty with `lua-resty-upstream` or a dedicated gateway (Envoy, Traefik) that can route dynamically based on path or query parameters.

## Serving the Web UI in package mode

> **Deployment status:** [CODE-SUPPORTED, UNQUALIFIED]. Serving the
> packaged UI tree is an operator-provided step — no qualification leg
> exercises it yet (the container package-smoke leg tracked in #549;
> #447 closed 2026-10-07). `scripts/install.sh` remains the qualified
> deployment path.

The `chv-controlplane` package ships the Web UI static tree at
`/usr/share/chv/ui`, and the control plane can serve it directly from
its own HTTP listener (`http_bind`, `127.0.0.1:8080` by default) —
decision D3 target, issue #447. Serving is **opt-in and disabled by
default** (fail-closed): no static assets are served unless the
operator enables the `[webui]` section. The package also ships an
example proxy-only nginx configuration at
`/usr/share/chv/examples/chv-example.conf` for operators who want an
edge (TLS termination, gzip, the `/ws/` console proxy) in front.

### Prerequisites

1. Provision the control plane first. Provide the TLS CA and
   certificates, a real `jwt_secret`, and the admin user. The control
   plane fails closed without them. See
   [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) "Post-Install Steps".
2. Start the CHV services and verify the loopback listeners: the BFF
   on `127.0.0.1:8080`, the agent serial console on `127.0.0.1:8444`.
   Do not expose either listener directly; an edge proxy is the only
   supported front door.

### Steps

1. Enable the Web UI in `/etc/chv/controlplane.toml`:

   ```toml
   [webui]
   enabled = true
   # dir = "/usr/share/chv/ui"   # the package default
   ```

2. Restart the control plane and verify it serves the UI shell:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart chv-controlplane
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/ | head
   ```

3. Optional edge: install the example proxy-only configuration (TLS
   termination, gzip, and the `/ws/` serial-console proxy):

   ```bash
   sudo cp /usr/share/chv/examples/chv-example.conf \
        /etc/nginx/sites-available/chv
   sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/chv /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/chv
   sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
   ```

### What the binary serves (and what it does not)

- Request paths outside the reserved API prefixes (`/v1`, `/api`,
  `/admin`, `/health*`, `/ready`, `/internal`, `/metrics`) are served
  from `dir`; unmatched ones fall back to `index.html` (the SPA
  fallback, `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`). Reserved prefixes
  keep the JSON 404 — an API miss stays machine-readable.
- Cache posture mirrors the previous nginx edge: `index.html` (and
  the SPA fallback) is served `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`;
  `/_app/immutable/` (SvelteKit's content-hashed assets) is served
  `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; other assets carry no
  `Cache-Control`.
- The router's security headers (CSP, `x-content-type-options`,
  `x-frame-options`, `referrer-policy`) apply to served assets.
- Static assets are unauthenticated (the login page must load before
  login); every API route keeps its existing auth and CSRF posture.

### Serial console requires the `/ws/` proxy

In proxied mode the BFF returns console URLs of the form
`/ws/vms/{node_id}/{vm_id}/console?token=...`. These URLs work only
through an edge that proxies `/ws/` to the agent on `127.0.0.1:8444`:
**the control plane binary does not proxy `/ws/`** (the #447 decision —
documented, not implemented; maintainer-ratified 2026-10-07; see the
issue). The example configuration includes this proxy. Do not remove
it; the VM serial console stops working without it.

### Notes

- TLS termination at the edge is an operator concern. See
  [DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md) §8 D7.
- The example configuration mirrors the one written by
  `scripts/install.sh` (both are proxy-only edges since #447; the
  binary owns static serving). The two copies can still drift.
- The tier label for serving-from-packages stays
  [CODE-SUPPORTED, UNQUALIFIED] until the container package-smoke leg
  (#549; #447 closed 2026-10-07) runs: enabling `[webui]` and starting
  the binary in a clean container, asserting the UI is served.

## Hosting the Installer (`get.cellhv.com`)

The `curl -sfL https://get.cellhv.com/ | sh -` pattern requires a lightweight endpoint that serves `scripts/install.sh` as plain text.

### Option A: GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo `cellhv/get.cellhv.com`
2. Add a `CNAME` file with `get.cellhv.com`
3. Serve `scripts/install.sh` as the index
4. Point DNS to GitHub Pages

### Option B: Cloudflare Worker
```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const installScript = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cellhv/chv/main/scripts/install.sh');
    return new Response(installScript.body, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
    });
  }
};
```

### Recommended Release Workflow
1. Developer runs `./scripts/build-release.sh`
2. CI uploads `dist/chv-<VERSION>-linux-amd64.tar.gz` to GitHub Releases
3. The installer script at `get.cellhv.com` queries the GitHub API for the latest release tag
4. End user runs `curl -sfL https://get.cellhv.com/ | sh -`

## Operations & Troubleshooting

### Restart Services
```bash
sudo systemctl restart chv-controlplane
sudo systemctl restart chv-agent
sudo systemctl restart chv-stord
sudo systemctl restart chv-nwd
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### View Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u chv-controlplane -f
sudo journalctl -u chv-agent -f
sudo journalctl -u chv-stord -f
sudo journalctl -u chv-nwd -f
```

### Post-deploy Web UI smoke test
```bash
./scripts/smoke-webui-auth.sh http://<host-or-ip>
```

### Agent Fails to Enroll
- Ensure `/etc/chv/bootstrap.token` exists and is readable by the `chv` user
- Verify the control plane is listening: `ss -tlnp | grep 8443`
- Check that the token was inserted into `bootstrap_tokens` and has not expired:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" \
    "SELECT description, expires_at, used_at FROM bootstrap_tokens;"
  ```
- Review agent logs: `journalctl -u chv-agent -n 100`

### `chv-stord` or `chv-nwd` Keep Restarting
- Check daemon logs for missing binary paths or permission errors
- Verify the `chv-stord` and `chv-nwd` binaries are executable (`/usr/bin` for package installs, `/usr/local/bin` for the manual procedure)

### Database Issues
The database is SQLite at `/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db`. It is created automatically by `chv-controlplane` on first start via sqlx migrations.

```bash
# Inspect the database
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" .tables
sqlite3 "file:/var/lib/chv/controlplane.db?mode=ro" "SELECT * FROM nodes;"

# Reset to clean state (destructive — removes all data)
sudo systemctl stop chv-controlplane chv-agent
sudo rm /var/lib/chv/controlplane.db
sudo systemctl start chv-controlplane
```

### Bridge / NAT Not Working
```bash
# Verify bridge is up
ip addr show chvbr0

# Verify IP forwarding
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

# Verify NAT rule
iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n -v

# Verify interface is attached to bridge
bridge link show
```

### Web UI Shows JSON Parse Error
This happens when API endpoints return HTML instead of JSON.

**Fix:** Ensure nginx `proxy_pass` does not have a trailing slash:
```nginx
location /v1/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;   # NO trailing slash after port
}
```

### Web UI Blank Page
- Verify `npm run build` succeeded and `index.html` exists in `/opt/chv/ui/`
- Check nginx `root` directive: `sudo nginx -T | grep root`

### Permission Denied on `/dev/kvm`
- Ensure the `chv` user is in the `kvm` group: `groups chv`
- If just added: `sudo systemctl restart chv-agent`

## Next Steps

- **Multi-node expansion (code-supported, unqualified):** The enrollment protocol is code-supported, but control-plane dispatch resolves a local Unix-socket path and cannot reach remote nodes. The qualified topology is single-host.
- **External storage:** Configure `chv-stord` backends for shared storage.
- **Networking:** Define tenant bridges and network segments via the Web UI or API.
- **TLS hardening:** Replace the self-signed CA with your organization's PKI.
