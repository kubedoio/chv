# Observability

CHV exports Prometheus metrics, structured logs, and per-request correlation IDs.
This document defines the operator-facing observability contract: what to scrape,
what to alert on, and how to investigate incidents.

## Metrics endpoints

| Service | Endpoint | Default bind |
|---|---|---|
| `chv-controlplane` | `/metrics` | `127.0.0.1:8080` (HTTP) |
| `chv-agent` | `/metrics` | configurable via `metrics_bind` in agent config |
| `chv-stord` | `/metrics` | configurable via `metrics_bind` in stord config |
| `chv-nwd` | `/metrics` | configurable via `metrics_bind` in nwd config |
| `chv-webui-bff` | served on same port as the BFF (default `127.0.0.1:8443`) | via `/metrics` route |

> The `metrics_bind` configuration keys default to `None` (disabled). Enable with
> e.g. `metrics_bind = "0.0.0.0:9090"` in the relevant config file. The control-plane
> always exposes `/metrics` on its `http_bind` address.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

SLIs are the measurable properties we use to assess service health. Each SLI is expressed
as a PromQL expression that can be evaluated continuously.

### SLI-1: VM start latency (p99)

**Definition:** 99th percentile of the time from `create_vm` invocation on the Cloud Hypervisor
adapter to the operation returning `Ok`. This covers the path from the agent accepting a start
command to the CH API completing.

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (le) (
    rate(chv_vm_op_duration_seconds_bucket{op="start"}[5m])
  )
)
```

**Good state:** < 30s. Degraded: 30–45s. Breaching: > 45s.

---

### SLI-2: VM lifecycle operation error rate

**Definition:** Fraction of VM lifecycle operations (create/start/stop/delete/pause/resume)
that return an error.

```promql
sum(rate(chv_vm_ops_total{result="err"}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(chv_vm_ops_total[5m]))
```

**Good state:** < 1%. Degraded: 1–5%. Breaching: > 5%.

---

### SLI-3: gRPC control-plane error rate

**Definition:** Fraction of gRPC requests to the control plane that return a non-OK gRPC status.

```promql
(
  sum(rate(chv_grpc_server_requests_total{grpc_status!~"^(0|OK)$"}[5m]))
  /
  sum(rate(chv_grpc_server_requests_total[5m]))
)
```

**Good state:** < 1%. Breaching: > 5% for 5 minutes.

---

### SLI-4: Control-plane convergence latency

**Definition:** Rolling average of the time for the control plane to converge desired to
observed state across all tracked resources.

```promql
chv_cp_convergence_avg_ms
```

**Good state:** < 5000ms. Degraded: 5000–10000ms. Breaching: > 10000ms.

---

### SLI-5: BFF API success rate

**Definition:** Fraction of HTTP requests to the webui-bff that return a non-5xx status code.

```promql
1 - (
  sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
  /
  sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
)
```

**Good state:** > 99.9%. Degraded: 99.5–99.9%. Breaching: < 99%.

---

### SLI-6: Node liveness

**Definition:** All enrolled CHV nodes are in a Ready state.

```promql
chv_nodes_ready
```

**Good state:** equals the expected node count. Breaching: any drop.

---

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

| SLI | Target | Measurement window | Alert threshold | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VM start p99 | < 30s | 30-day rolling | > 45s for 10m | warning |
| VM op error rate | < 1% | 30-day rolling | > 5% for 5m | warning |
| gRPC error rate | < 1% | 30-day rolling | > 5% for 5m | warning |
| Convergence latency | < 5000ms avg | 30-day rolling | > 10000ms for 10m | warning |
| BFF API success | > 99.9% | 30-day rolling | < 99% for 5m | warning |
| Node liveness | 100% | 7-day rolling | any drop > 2m | critical |

Error budget: for each SLO the error budget is 1 – target over the window. When an alert fires,
check the recording rules (`chv:*:5m`) to see whether you are on track to exhaust the error budget.

## Key metrics reference

### VM lifecycle (`chv-agent-runtime-ch`)

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chv_vm_ops_total` | counter | `op`, `result` | VM lifecycle operation count. `op` ∈ {create,start,stop,delete,pause,resume}; `result` ∈ {ok,err} |
| `chv_vm_op_duration_seconds` | histogram | `op` | Duration of VM lifecycle operations (both ok and err paths) |

### gRPC server (`chv-observability GrpcMetricsLayer`)

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chv_grpc_server_requests_total` | counter | `service`, `method`, `grpc_status` | gRPC request count per method |
| `chv_grpc_server_duration_seconds` | histogram | `service`, `method`, `grpc_status` | gRPC request duration |

> `grpc_status` is the numeric gRPC status code (`"0"` = OK). For streaming responses where
> the trailer cannot be read before body completion, the label is `"unknown"`.

### Control-plane convergence

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chv_cp_drift_count` | gauge | — | Number of resources currently diverged from desired state |
| `chv_cp_pending_operations` | gauge | — | Operations in the orchestrator queue |
| `chv_cp_convergence_avg_ms` | gauge | — | Rolling average convergence time in milliseconds |

## Logs

All CHV daemons emit structured logs via the `tracing` crate (see ADR-009). Log
format is configurable:

```bash
# JSON (production)
CHV_LOG_FORMAT=json chv-agent ...

# Pretty (development)
CHV_LOG_FORMAT=pretty chv-agent ...   # or unset
```

### Filtering logs by operation

Every operation carries an `operation_id` span field. To trace a specific operation:

```bash
# systemd journal
journalctl -u chv-agent -o json | jq 'select(.operation_id == "abc123ef")'

# File log
grep '"operation_id":"abc123ef"' /var/log/chv/agent.log
```

Every HTTP error response body includes a `request_id` field that matches the
`x-correlation-id` response header. Use this to correlate a user-visible error back to
server-side logs:

```bash
# User reports: request_id = "x7k9p2"
journalctl -u chv-controlplane -o json | jq 'select(.fields.correlation_id == "x7k9p2")'
```

---

## Distributed tracing

> **Note:** OTLP/OpenTelemetry export is not yet enabled in production (deferred — see finding C-12).
> Trace IDs are present in logs as `correlation_id` / `request_id` fields and are propagated via the
> `x-correlation-id` HTTP header. When OTLP support lands, this section will be updated with
> collector configuration and trace query examples.
