# First Release Go/No-Go Checklist

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Purpose:** Machine-readable checklist for release readiness decisions.  

## Usage

Run each section in order. Do not skip sections. Each section must pass 100% before proceeding to the next. Mark items `[x]` only after confirming with evidence.

---

## Section A — Build and Version Integrity

**Goal:** The codebase builds cleanly and reports the correct version.

- [x] A.1 `cat VERSION` returns `0.1.0`
- [x] A.2 `grep -E '^version' cmd/*/Cargo.toml | sort -u | wc -l` returns `1` (all binaries share one version)
- [x] A.3 `cargo build --workspace --release` completes without errors
- [x] A.4 `cargo test --workspace` passes (all tests green)
- [x] A.5 `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` passes
- [x] A.6 `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes
- [x] A.7 `./target/release/chvctl --version` shows `0.1.0` (or `0.1.0-rc.N` for RC)
- [x] A.8 `./target/release/chvctl --version` shows git commit SHA and build date
- [x] A.9 `./scripts/check-release-local.sh` runs and reports `ALL CHECKS PASSED`
- [x] A.10 `CHANGELOG.md` contains a section for `0.1.0`

**Section A Status:** PASS / FAIL: __________

## Overall Decision

| Section | Status | Blocker? |
|---------|--------|----------|
| A — Build Integrity | PASS | No |
| B — Package Generation | PASS | No |
| C — Script Safety | PASS | No |
| D — Smoke Tests | PASS (CI only) | No |
| E — Lifecycle Tests | PASS (CI only) | No |
| F — CI/CD Workflows | PASS | No |
| G — Trust Artifacts | PASS | No |
| H — Release Tarball | PASS | No |
| I — Install Docs | PASS with conditions | **Yes** — I.8 and I.9 must be fixed |
| J — Post-Release | Not yet run | Will be run after tag |

### Decision

- [ ] **GO** for `v0.1.0` stable
- [ ] **GO** for `v0.1.0-rc.1` with follow-up items
- [ ] **NO-GO** — fix blockers first

**Recommended action:** Fix items I.8 and I.9 (update `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `install.sh` version references), then tag `v0.1.0-rc.1` to validate the full pipeline. Promote to stable after RC validation passes.
