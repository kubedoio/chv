## Source of Truth

| What | File | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| Semantic version | `VERSION` | Plain text, e.g. `X.Y.Z` |
| Per-crate version | `cmd/*/Cargo.toml` | Must match `VERSION` |
| Rust toolchain | `rust-toolchain.toml` | Exact channel pin, e.g. `1.98.1` |
| Changelog | `CHANGELOG.md` | Keep a Changelog format |
| Git tag | `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` | Must match `VERSION` |

**Rule:** All 5 binary crates (`chv-controlplane`, `chv-agent`, `chv-stord`, `chv-nwd`, `chvctl`) share the same version. CI validates this.

### Rust toolchain (#229)

- **Source of truth:** `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the exact compiler channel.
  rustup resolves it automatically for local development; CI, KVM integration,
  nightly, PR-package, and release workflows install it through the in-repo
  composite action `.github/actions/setup-rust`, which reads the same pin and
  never selects a toolchain on its own.
- **Why:** a floating `stable` let CI behavior change without any repository
  commit (new lints in generated tonic/prost output failing unrelated PRs,
  silently changed compiler behavior in release artifacts). The pin makes the
  compiler input of every artifact reviewable and reproducible.
- **Generated-code policy:** handwritten Rust stays `-D warnings`; the
  generated crates under `gen/rust/*/src/lib.rs` carry only the narrow
  crate-root `#![allow(clippy::result_large_err)]`. Generated files are
  regenerated (`cargo build --workspace`), never hand-patched. A new compiler
  lint can only be addressed by (in order of preference) a generator update, a
  new narrow crate-root allow with review rationale, or a toolchain bump —
  never a global `allow(warnings)`.

**Toolchain-bump procedure:**

1. Open a PR changing **only** the `channel` value in `rust-toolchain.toml`
   (plus, if needed, a narrow generated-code lint adjustment).
2. CI (fmt/check/clippy/test), Security, and package smoke must pass on that
   PR — they run the proposed toolchain.
3. Merge as a reviewable tooling change. Never let a workflow select a
   different toolchain than the pin declares.
4. Cadence: bump deliberately (e.g. with each minor release line), not
   automatically. Coordinate MSRV-sensitive migrations (e.g. the deferred
   tonic 0.12 → 0.14 upgrade, which changes generated output and MSRV) with a
   bump so the two changes do not fight each other.

## File Map (Who Calls Whom)

### Version Derivation
```
VERSION ──▶ scripts/version.sh ──▶ deb: <version>~rc.1
                              ──▶ rpm: <version>-0.1.rc1
                              ──▶ nightly: <version>~nightly.<date>.g<sha>
```
- Called by: `scripts/build-packages.sh`, CI workflows, Makefile
- Environment override: `CHV_PKG_PRERELEASE` (set by CI for RC builds)

### Build
```
Makefile:build-release ──▶ cargo build --workspace --release
                        ──▶ cd ui && npm ci && npm run build
                        ──▶ tar -czf dist/chv-VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
- Version metadata injected via `cmd/*/build.rs` (CHV_VERSION, CHV_GIT_SHA, CHV_BUILD_DATE, CHV_RELEASE_CHANNEL)
- Binaries respond to `--version` with: `chvctl <version> (commit <sha>, build <date>, channel stable)`

### Package Generation
```
scripts/build-packages.sh ──▶ nfpm package -f config.yaml -p deb/rpm
   │
   ├── packaging/nfpm/chv-controlplane.yaml  → chv-controlplane_<version>_amd64.deb
   ├── packaging/nfpm/chv-node.yaml          → chv-node_<version>_amd64.deb
   └── packaging/nfpm/chvctl.yaml            → chvctl_<version>_amd64.deb
   └── packaging/scripts/postinstall.sh      → runs on package install
   └── packaging/scripts/preremove.sh        → runs before package removal
   └── packaging/scripts/postremove.sh       → runs after package removal
```
- **Tool:** nFPM v2.41.1 (pinned in CI)
- **Formats:** `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `.rpm` (RHEL/Rocky/Alma/Fedora)
- **Package `chv-node` depends on `chv-controlplane`** (plus `wireguard-tools`: hard dependency in `.deb`, `recommends` in `.rpm`)
- Config files marked `config|noreplace` (survive upgrades)
- Services installed but NOT auto-started

### Testing
```
scripts/package/smoke-deb.sh     → installs .deb in clean Debian container, checks binaries
scripts/package/smoke-rpm.sh     → installs .rpm in clean Rocky container, checks binaries
scripts/package/lifecycle-deb.sh → install → upgrade → remove → reinstall with sentinel files
scripts/package/lifecycle-rpm.sh → same for RPM
```
- Sentinel files in `/var/lib/chv/` and `/etc/chv/` prove data survives operations
- Lifecycle tests require Docker

### CI/CD Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does | Runner |
|----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| `ci.yml` | push/PR to `main` | fmt, clippy, test, version check | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `package-pr.yml` | PR to `main`, push to other branches | build, package, smoke deb/rpm | `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc 2.35 pin — oldest smoke target is debian:12/glibc 2.36) |
| `package-nightly.yml` | push to `main`, dispatch | build, package, smoke, lifecycle, publish pre-release | `ubuntu-22.04` (build job; same glibc pin) |
| `release.yml` | tag `v*`, dispatch | full pipeline + SBOM + signing + GitHub Release | build job `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc pin); package/release jobs `ubuntu-latest` (binaries only run in containers) |
| `integration-kvm.yml` | dispatch, PR label, push `main` | host diagnostics, KVM tests, package install | self-hosted `chv-kvm` |

**Workflow dependencies:**
```
ci.yml ──▶ (gates PRs)
package-pr.yml ──▶ produces artifacts (7 day retention)
release.yml:build ──▶ release.yml:package ──▶ release.yml:release ──▶ release.yml:publish-repo
```

### Signing and Trust Artifacts
```
dist/packages/SHA256SUMS ──▶ scripts/release/sign-checksums.sh
   ├── SHA256SUMS.sig       (GPG, if CHV_RELEASE_GPG_KEY secret set)
   └── SHA256SUMS.cosign.sig (Cosign, if CHV_RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY secret set)

SBOM:
   ├── dist/sbom.spdx.json      (anchore/sbom-action)
   └── dist/sbom.cyclonedx.json (anchore/sbom-action)

Provenance:
   └── GitHub artifact attestation (actions/attest-build-provenance)
```
- Signing gracefully degrades if secrets are missing
- No signing keys are currently configured

### Publishing
```
GitHub Release (always):
   └── Created by softprops/action-gh-release@v2

Package Repository (optional, requires secrets):
   └── scripts/publish/publish-repo.sh
       ├── apt repository (dpkg-scanpackages + GPG-signed Release/InRelease)
       └── yum repository (createrepo_c + GPG-signed repomd.xml)
       └── Upload: S3 sync OR rsync
```
- Repo publish is dry-run by default (no credentials = prints what it would do)

```

### Release a New Version

```bash
# 1. Bump version
make bump-version BUMP_TYPE=patch   # or: minor / major

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
# 3. Commit and push

git tag v<version>
git push origin v<version>

# For RC:
git tag v<version>-rc.1
git push origin v<version>-rc.1
```

## Key Decisions and Rationale

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **nFPM instead of cargo-deb/cargo-rpm** | Single tool generates both formats; simpler config (YAML); handles maintainer scripts natively |
| **Generic maintainer scripts** | One `postinstall.sh`/`preremove.sh`/`postremove.sh` for all packages instead of per-package scripts. Safer, easier to maintain, no duplication |
| **Services NOT auto-started** | User must configure network/storage first. Prevents broken first-boot states |
| **Config files `config\|noreplace`** | Modified configs survive package upgrades. No silent overwrites |
| **`/var/lib/chv` and `/etc/chv` preserved on remove** | Data safety. Intentional design choice. User can purge manually if needed |
| **No purge script** | Not implemented. Package remove preserves data by design |
| **Self-hosted runner for KVM** | GitHub-hosted runners don't support nested virtualization. KVM tests need bare-metal or dedicated VM |
| **Rolling nightly pre-release** | Single `nightly` tag on GitHub that gets overwritten. Avoids clutter. Users pin to specific nightly versions via exact filename |
| **GPG + Cosign dual signing** | GPG for traditional package manager trust; Cosign for modern Sigstore ecosystem |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `nfpm: command not found` | nFPM not installed | `go install github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/v2/cmd/nfpm@latest` or download binary |
| `envsubst: command not found` | gettext not installed | `sudo apt-get install gettext-base` |
| Smoke tests fail with "Docker not available" | Docker daemon not running | `sudo systemctl start docker` or run in CI |
| `rpm` command not found (on Debian) | Can't inspect RPM metadata locally | Use CI, or install `rpm` package |
| `systemd-analyze verify` fails locally | Binaries not in `/usr/bin/` during build | Expected in build container; verified in smoke tests instead |
| Release workflow fails at "Create GitHub Release" | Missing `contents: write` permission | Check workflow `permissions` block |
| Signing step shows "SIGNING NOT CONFIGURED" | Secrets not set | Add `CHV_RELEASE_GPG_KEY` or `CHV_RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY` to repo secrets |
| `local: can only be used in a function` | Bash `local` outside function | Fix: remove `local` keyword from top-level code |
| Nightly RPM sorts newer than the stable release | `^` in an RPM version marks a post-release snapshot and sorts above the base version | Expected behavior. Upgrade to the next stable version, or force the same-base stable with `rpm -U --oldpackage` |

## LLM Agent Quick Reference

**If the user asks you to:**
- "Build packages" → run `make package-local` or `make package-deb` / `make package-rpm`
- "Run smoke tests" → run `make package-smoke-deb` and `make package-smoke-rpm` (requires Docker)
- "Cut a release" → bump VERSION, update CHANGELOG, commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push tag
- "Fix the install script" → edit `scripts/install.sh` (not the hosting scripts unless explicitly asked)
- "Update version everywhere" → run `make bump-version BUMP_TYPE=<major|minor|patch>`
- "Review release workflow" → read `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `docs/release/PIPELINE.md`
- "Sign artifacts" → check if `CHV_RELEASE_GPG_KEY` or `CHV_RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY` secrets exist; if not, explain graceful degradation

**Before modifying any packaging or release file:**
1. Read this document (`docs/release/PIPELINE.md`)
2. Read the specific file you're changing
3. Check if the change affects other files in the pipeline (use the File Map above)
4. Run `make check-release-local` after changes

**Files you should NOT modify without explicit user approval:**
- `packaging/scripts/postinstall.sh`, `preremove.sh`, `postremove.sh` (run as root on user machines)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` environment protection rules
- `scripts/install.sh` when it downloads and executes binaries
