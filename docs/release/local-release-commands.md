## Scripts

### `scripts/check-release-local.sh`

Runs the full pre-release validation suite:

1. Formatting check (`cargo fmt --all -- --check`)
2. Lint (`cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`)
3. Tests (`cargo test --workspace`)
4. Release build (`cargo build --workspace --release`)
5. Version output check (`chvctl version`)

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/check-release-local.sh
# or via Makefile
make check
```

### `scripts/build-release.sh`

Builds a release tarball for linux-amd64 including binaries, UI assets, systemd units, example configs, and an install script.

Output: `dist/chv-<VERSION>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh
# or via Makefile
make release
```

### `scripts/build-packages.sh`

Builds `.deb` and `.rpm` packages using `nfpm`.

Usage:
```bash
# Build both formats
./scripts/build-packages.sh

# Skip Rust/UI build (use existing artifacts)
./scripts/build-packages.sh --skip-build

# Build only one format
./scripts/build-packages.sh --format deb
./scripts/build-packages.sh --format rpm
```

### `scripts/smoke-packages.sh`

Verifies that release binaries, UI build, and packaging configs are present and valid. Optionally builds and inspects packages if `nfpm` is available.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/smoke-packages.sh
# or via Makefile
make package-smoke
```

### `scripts/package/check-package-files.sh`

Validates that package files were produced, contain the expected version, are non-empty, and have valid metadata.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/package/check-package-files.sh
# or via Makefile
make package-check
```

### `scripts/package/check-safety.sh`

Audits packaging scripts and configs for safety:
- Systemd units are present and reference correct paths
- Config files are marked `config|noreplace`
- Maintainer scripts are executable
- No destructive commands (disk formatting, bridge creation, data deletion)

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/package/check-safety.sh
# or via Makefile
make package-safety
```

### `scripts/package/smoke-deb.sh`

Runs install/remove/reinstall smoke tests for `.deb` packages inside Docker containers.

Supported images (default): `debian:12`, `ubuntu:24.04`

Usage:
```bash
# Test default images with packages from dist/packages/
./scripts/package/smoke-deb.sh

# Test with a specific package directory
./scripts/package/smoke-deb.sh dist/packages

# Test custom images
IMAGES="debian:12 ubuntu:22.04" ./scripts/package/smoke-deb.sh

# or via Makefile
make package-smoke-deb
```

### `scripts/package/smoke-rpm.sh`

Runs install/remove/reinstall smoke tests for `.rpm` packages inside Docker containers.

Supported images (default): `rockylinux:9`

Usage:
```bash
# Test default images with packages from dist/packages/
./scripts/package/smoke-rpm.sh

# Test with a specific package directory
./scripts/package/smoke-rpm.sh dist/packages

# Test custom images
IMAGES="rockylinux:9 almalinux:9" ./scripts/package/smoke-rpm.sh

# or via Makefile
make package-smoke-rpm
```

### `scripts/publish/publish-repo.sh`

Generates apt and yum repository metadata from built packages and optionally uploads to a configured repository target. Runs in dry-run mode if no upload credentials are configured.

Usage:
```bash
# Dry-run (default when no secrets configured)
./scripts/publish/publish-repo.sh --packages dist/packages --channel nightly --version 0.1.0~nightly.20260510.g0872c4a7 --dry-run

# With S3 credentials in environment
export CHV_REPO_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
./scripts/publish/publish-repo.sh --packages dist/packages --channel nightly --version 0.1.0~nightly.20260510.g0872c4a7

# or via Makefile
make publish-repo-dry-run
```

### `scripts/release/extract-changelog.sh`

Extracts the changelog section for a specific version from `CHANGELOG.md`. Fails with a clear error if the section is missing.

Usage:
```bash
# Extract section for current VERSION
./scripts/release/extract-changelog.sh $(cat VERSION)

# Extract section for a specific version
./scripts/release/extract-changelog.sh 0.1.0
./scripts/release/extract-changelog.sh 0.1.0-rc.1

# or via Makefile
make changelog
```

### `scripts/release/sign-checksums.sh`

Signs `SHA256SUMS` with GPG or Cosign if signing secrets are configured. Falls back to a clear TODO message if no secrets are present.

Usage:
```bash
# Sign with GPG (requires CHV_RELEASE_GPG_KEY env var)
CHV_RELEASE_GPG_KEY="$(cat signing-key.asc)" ./scripts/release/sign-checksums.sh dist/packages/SHA256SUMS

# Sign with Cosign (requires CHV_RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY env var)
CHV_RELEASE_COSIGN_KEY="$(cat cosign.key)" ./scripts/release/sign-checksums.sh dist/packages/SHA256SUMS

# or via Makefile
make sign-checksums
```

### `scripts/package/lifecycle-deb.sh` and `lifecycle-rpm.sh`

Run full package lifecycle tests in Docker containers:
- Fresh install
- Create sentinel state (persistent data + config modifications)
- Reinstall same version
- Upgrade from old to new version
- Remove packages
- Verify persistent data and configs are preserved
- Reinstall after remove
- Verify sentinel state survives all operations

Usage:
```bash
# Debian lifecycle test
./scripts/package/lifecycle-deb.sh --new-packages dist/packages --old-packages dist/packages-old

# RPM lifecycle test
./scripts/package/lifecycle-rpm.sh --new-packages dist/packages --old-packages dist/packages-old

# Both (via Makefile)
make package-lifecycle
```

> **Note:** Upgrade tests require old packages. The Makefile automatically builds version `0.0.1` packages as the "old" version if `dist/packages-old/` does not exist.

### `scripts/integration/kvm-smoke.sh`

Runs host-level integration tests on real KVM hardware. This script requires:
- `/dev/kvm` access
- `cloud-hypervisor` binary (auto-downloaded if missing)
- Root privileges (for package install and network operations)

Test steps:
1. Host diagnostics (CPU flags, memory, disk)
2. Verify `/dev/kvm`
3. Verify/install `cloud-hypervisor`
4. Install CHV packages or use local binaries
5. Binary version checks
6. Systemd unit validation
7. Generate temporary dev TLS certs and configs
8. Start controlplane, stord, nwd, agent
9. Verify processes stay alive and ports respond
10. Collect logs
11. Cleanup (unless `--skip-cleanup`)

> **VM lifecycle testing is TODO** — pending stable enrollment, image distribution, and network bridge setup.

Usage:
```bash
# Run with built packages (default workflow)
sudo ./scripts/integration/kvm-smoke.sh --packages dist/packages

# Run with locally built binaries
sudo ./scripts/integration/kvm-smoke.sh --source

# Run with a specific binary directory
sudo ./scripts/integration/kvm-smoke.sh --binary-dir /opt/chv/bin

# Debug mode — skip cleanup
sudo ./scripts/integration/kvm-smoke.sh --packages dist/packages --skip-cleanup

# or via Makefile
make integration-kvm          # build + package + test
make integration-kvm-source   # test with local binaries
make integration-kvm-packages # test with existing packages
```

## Troubleshooting

### `cargo clippy` fails with warnings
Fix the warnings or run `cargo clippy --workspace` to see them without the `-D warnings` strictness.

### `nfpm` not found
Install with:
```bash
go install github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/v2/cmd/nfpm@latest
```

### `envsubst` not found
Install with:
```bash
apt-get install gettext   # Debian/Ubuntu
dnf install gettext       # Fedora/RHEL
```

### Tests fail with protobuf errors
Install `protoc`:
```bash
apt-get install protobuf-compiler   # Debian/Ubuntu
dnf install protobuf-compiler       # Fedora/RHEL
```

## Optional Tools

The following tools are not required but recommended for additional validation:

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| `cargo-audit` | Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities | `cargo install cargo-audit` |
| `cargo-deny` | Enforce dependency policies (licenses, advisories, bans) | `cargo install cargo-deny` |
| `cargo-nextest` | Faster test runner with better output and filtering | `cargo install cargo-nextest` |

## Service Management

After installing packages, services are present but not automatically started or enabled:

```bash
# Reload systemd to recognize new units
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable and start control plane
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-controlplane

# Enable and start node services
sudo systemctl enable --now chv-agent chv-stord chv-nwd

# Check status
sudo systemctl status chv-agent
```

> **Note:** Services require configuration (TLS certs, `jwt_secret`, `control_plane_addr`) before they can start successfully. See `/etc/chv/*.toml` for per-service config files.

## CI Parity

The local `make check` command runs the same checks as the Rust CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --workspace`
- Version validation (`chvctl version`)
