#
# THE M4.7 DELTA (vs M4.3/M4.5/M4.6, all live-proven there):
#   - M4.3 proved restart-at-rest legs (agent SIGKILL while Running →
#     re-adopt same CH pid; CP restart; 60 s outage; full-stack restart).
#   - M4.5 proved stord SIGKILL under a running (idle) VM + respawn.
#   - M4.6 N9 proved migration interruption by killing the DESTINATION
#     stord mid-BULK_COPY.
#   - M4.7 kills services WHILE AN OPERATION IS IN FLIGHT (mid-create,
#     mid-start, mid-provision, mid-migration) and asserts the forbidden
#     outcomes never occur REGARDLESS of which side of the race window
#     the death landed on.
#
# Legs (plan §M4.7). One base VM (create → start → Running, booted to
# logind so later stops are ACPI-safe) is reused by several legs; every
# other leg creates its own small VM and cleans it up:
#
#   F1  CP SIGKILL mid-create: submit a fresh VM create, SIGKILL the
#       control-plane the moment the CreateVm op is claimed (Running),
#       restart it. The op must reach a terminal state in a bounded
#       window (converged-Created or cleanly-Failed — #368 disclosure:
#       a terminally-failed create is a PASS, fail-closed; the recorded
#       #368 boundary shape — CP op Succeeded while the core effect
#       failed, a phantom VM row that neither converges nor observably
#       fails — is a WARN with disclosure), with the correct VMM
#       process shape (a converged create has EXACTLY ONE idle VMM —
#       spawn-at-create is the product design, crates/
#       chv-agent-runtime-ch/src/process.rs create_vm; a failed create
#       has none), disk row ↔ physical volume consistency, no orphaned
#       tap, and the base VM undisturbed. Cleanup, then RETRY the
#       create → must converge.
#   F2  Agent SIGKILL mid-start: a created-stopped VM; submit start,
#       SIGKILL the agent the moment the StartVm op is claimed; restart
#       the agent. No double-spawn (≤1 CH process for the VM; exactly
#       one stord/nwd — the restarted supervisor must adopt the living
#       daemons, not respawn duplicates); VM ends Running or the start
#       fails cleanly; retry start → Running; base VM undisturbed.
#   F3  Stord SIGKILL mid-provision: base VM Running; submit a fresh VM
#       create (its boot-volume provision+attach is the only operator-
#       reachable volume path on a core-managed node — the standalone
#       attach_volume/detach_volume RPCs fail closed there; recorded),
#       SIGKILL the deployed stord the moment the volume backing starts
#       materializing (the M4.5-proven multi-second seed-conversion
#       window); wait for the supervisor respawn (#376: the LIVE
#       stord's config/DB path resolves via its argv, not the deploy
#       path). Attach converges or fails cleanly; disk consistency;
#       base VM undisturbed (CH holds the disk fd). Retry the create on
#       the respawned stord → converges; delete closes the session (the
#       detach/delete contract for this topology).
#   F4  nwd SIGKILL mid-create (tap provision): submit a fresh VM
#       create, SIGKILL nwd the moment the CreateVm op is claimed (the
#       NIC attach — tap provision — runs inside the create); wait for
#       the supervisor respawn. Create converges or fails cleanly; no
#       duplicate CH process; NO orphaned tap once the leg settles;
#       retry create → converges.
#   F5  Migration interruption, SOURCE side (extends M4.6 N9, which
#       killed the destination): the M4.6 two-standalone-stord mTLS
#       topology (NOT agent-supervised, #385); trigger a seeded 4 GiB
#       migration, SIGKILL the SOURCE stord mid-BULK_COPY. The task
#       state dies with the daemon (in-memory) — assert no zombie task
#       after restart, the destination partial volume is RETAINED
#       (create_new semantics), then the documented recovery: restart
#       the source, hit the create_new refusal, remove the partial,
#       re-trigger → COMPLETED + digest verify.
#   F6  CP loss mid-migration: fresh migration on the same topology;
#       SIGKILL the CP mid-BULK_COPY, restart it. The stord↔stord path
#       is direct (M4.6 declared the CP path out of scope) — assert the
#       honest behavior: the transfer keeps advancing through the
#       outage, completes with digest verification, the CP journals no
#       duplicate/phantom work across its restart, and the base VM is
#       undisturbed. Whatever the task record shows, NO forbidden
#       outcome may occur; the observed behavior is disclosed plainly.
#   F7  Idempotent cleanup / repeated retry: delete the base VM →
#       absence (or the documented M2.5 retention, recorded); SECOND
#       delete → clean not-found or idempotent success (never a
#       crash-class error); stop an already-stopped VM → clean; delete
#       a VM whose create is still in flight → converges to absence
#       with no orphaned disk/tap; final global sweep: zero CH
#       processes, zero tap- interfaces, disk row ↔ physical volume
#       bijection, live stord sessions all closed, every journaled op
#       terminal, exactly one CreateVm op row per created VM.
#
# FORBIDDEN OUTCOMES (asserted by shared checkers after EVERY leg; a
# leg that "eventually succeeds" while leaving any of these behind
# FAILS the milestone):
#   - duplicate VM processes: >1 cloud-hypervisor process for a VM, or
#     a global CH count above the number of extant VMs — Running VMs
#     AND created-not-started VMs (each holds one idle VMM spawned at
#     create, process.rs create_vm) — and zero after deletes;
#   - duplicate stord/nwd daemons after an agent restart (the supervisor
#     must adopt the living daemon via its socket, never double-spawn);
#   - lost/duplicated authoritative state: a CP volume row without its
#     physical backing for a live VM, a physical volume without a row,
#     a duplicated CreateVm operation row, or ops stuck non-terminal
#     forever (a terminally-FAILED op is the #368 fail-closed truth and
#     a PASS with disclosure — only eternal Running/Accepted is an
#     error);
#   - orphaned disks/taps: a tap- interface without its VM, a volume
#     backing without its row, a stord session without its volume.
#
# RACE-WINDOW DESIGN: every kill is a race. Each leg polls tightly
# (0.2 s) for the operation to be claimed (op status Running) or for
# the host effect to start (backing file appearing) and kills INSIDE
# the window; if the window is missed (the op already converged), the
# kill still happens and the leg's assertions are unchanged — both
# sides of every race are acceptable outcomes and every assertion is
# written as "converges OR fails cleanly", never as "must converge".
#
# Timing notes (inherited from M2.5/M4.3/M4.5, same host class): guest
# boots to logind in ~10-60 s (kernel banner within 300 s; nested-virt
# margin on top), the graceful stop needs up to ~32 s inside the
# agent's 60 s window, the CP's stuck-Running reaper recycles a
# mid-dispatch CreateVm after 120 s (hence the 300 s op-settle window),
# and the agent supervisor respawns a killed stord/nwd within one
# ~30 s reconcile tick. Boot waits dominate the ~25 min budget: the
# base VM boots once (preamble) and the F2 VM once (for ACPI-safe
# stops later); all other legs only create (no boot).
#
# EXPECTED PASS COUNTS (deterministic qual_pass sites per section, on the
# converged/happy path — every branch's deviation is disclosed inline; the
# deploy phase adds ~20 of its own before the scenario starts; race
# disjunction branches can add qual_warn lines but never silently remove
# a pass — a window-missed branch converts exactly one pass into a warn
# and is named below):
