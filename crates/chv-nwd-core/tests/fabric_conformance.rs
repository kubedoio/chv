//! CHV-side gate for the shared fabric provider contract.
//!
//! The `fabric-conformance` crate ships one executable suite that runs
//! against the reference in-memory fake kernel (`fabric_linux::RecordingRunner`).
//! Running it here as an integration test keeps the CHV build pinned to a
//! `fabric` provider revision that satisfies the fabric provider contract
//! (`contracts/fabric-provider-v1.md` in the o3kio/fabric repository), so a
//! future provider bump that breaks the contract fails CHV CI instead of
//! surfacing on hosts.
//!
//! Per ADR-021 and the implementation plan (Phase 1), this is the
//! unprivileged conformance gate; the privileged multi-host gate is a
//! separate harness in the fabric repository.
