//! Admin API for migration operations.
//!
//! Currently exposes a single endpoint: `POST /admin/migrations/{id}/cancel`,
//! which sets the cooperative cancel flag for an in-flight migration. The
//! migration loop polls the flag at safe points and rolls back when it fires.
//!
//! See [`crate::migration::request_migration_cancel`] for the underlying
//! semantics, including idempotency and terminal-phase no-op behavior.
