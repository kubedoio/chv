//! NetBox projection worker — the composition root of the projection
//! (PR 4 of the #239 plan).
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::backup_worker::BackupWorker`]'s loop shape: a
//! clone-able struct, a `run(shutdown_rx)` tokio loop on a 30s tick,
//! `warn!`-and-continue on tick errors, never a panic. Each tick:
//!
//! 1. **Reclamation** — runs stuck in `running` for more than
//!    [`RUN_LEASE_TIMEOUT`] (worker crash / stall) are failed by the
//!    store's CAS-guarded `reclaim_stale_running`; a reclaimed run is
//!    retried through the normal requeue path and re-enters
//!    idempotently via the external-id match.
//! 2. **Post-apply sweep** (PR 6) — for every architecture whose
//!    config has `enable_post_apply = true`, enqueue a `post_apply`
//!    export run for the most recent `succeeded` apply run's version,
//!    unless one already exists for that version (idempotent across
//!    ticks) or an active run holds the architecture's one-active slot
//!    (coalescing). See [`Self::enqueue_post_apply_triggers`].
//! 3. **Claim** — one queued run per architecture per tick
//!    (`list_architecture_ids_with_queued` + `claim_next_queued`; the
//!    claim is a single atomic UPDATE, so concurrent workers cannot
//!    double-claim).
//! 4. **Execute** — load the config and decrypt the token in-memory
//!    (fail-closed), resolve the applied version, parse the
//!    `CHVArchitecture` model, and hand plain data to
//!    [`chv_netbox_adapter::NetboxProjectionRunner`]. The adapter stays
//!    store-free; this worker is the only place the two worlds meet.
//! 5. **Persist** — `mark_succeeded` with the serialized outcome and
//!    plan summary, or `mark_failed` with a redacted, secret-free
//!    error message (plus the per-entry outcome ledger when the run
//!    partially executed), plus an `EventType::Audit` event carrying
//!    the run/architecture ids and summary (never the token).
//!    Transient failures (NetBox unreachable, auth rejected, server
//!    5xx) are requeued for an automatic, exponentially backed-off
//!    retry bounded by the store's attempt cap; permanent failures
//!    stay `failed`.
//!
//! A NetBox outage never kills the worker: every error path marks the
//! run failed, emits an event, and continues to the next tick.

    ///   post_apply — holds the architecture's one-active slot, so the
