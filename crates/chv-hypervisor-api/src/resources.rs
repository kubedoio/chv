//! Shared VM resource conventions and the neutral host-resource controller trait.
//!
//! This module is the low shared crate boundary for the Core-driven
//! single-effector runtime (M2.2a). It carries:
//!
//! - pure path/string conventions (VM runtime dir, API socket, bridge name,
//!   NIC id, default NIC CIDR) that both the legacy reconcile path and the Core
//!   runtime share without duplicates;
//! - [`ensure_vm_runtime_dir`] which creates the per-VM runtime directory with
//!   the canonical 0o775 mode and a tolerant `chv-stord` group chown;
//! - [`HostResourceController`], the trait through which `CloudHypervisorCoreRuntime`
//!   performs all stord/nwd side effects without depending on `chv-agent-core`.
